## Summary
 1.) The advantages to refratoring code is that the code becomes more effecient and quicker.  Ideally it should help to decluter code to make it easy to read, so if you return to adjust the code later it is easy to understand and continue working. In this case we can see that there was a significant shorter run time in the refractored code.

2.) The disadvanages to refratoring code is that in situation for complex unstructed code it might be best to split it in several functions.  In this case it was an appropriate choice.
